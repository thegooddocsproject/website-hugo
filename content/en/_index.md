## Why?
We want to help open source projects be more effective by helping them lift the quality of their documentation.

## How?
We create processes, templates, and guides covering the numerous aspects of writing good documentation.
We describe our reasoning and provide research to empower writers and non-writers alike to understand the deeper concepts and principles of effective technical writing.

## What?
Every project deserves a minimum level of good docs, but it can be hard to know where to start or write. Our open-source suite of templates will help you create a baseline documentation set.

## Who?
Our key target audiences are:

* Software developers who want to use guides and templates to create documentation for their projects.
* Technical writers setting up a documentation framework who want to use established templates and processes, customizing where appropriate, to align with the projectâ€™s goals.
* Project owners who need to balance project priorities and want to understand the return-on-effort associated with different documentation strategies.

## Download

* The latest development version of templates is available from the [github main branch](https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/templates).
* The [0.1 alpha straw-man release of templates](https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/templates/releases/tag/v0.1) was released at 2019 Write The Docs - Australia conference.

## 2021 Initiatives
The following initiatives are being worked on in 2021:
* Templates
* Cross-domain management of glossaries 
* How-to for style guides
* Base template (template for templates)

And possibly:
* Docs audit framework
* Implementing a style guide in tools
* Integrate doc tool chains
* Doc format conversion tools
