We kicked off the shareable glossary project in mid-2020, and by January 2022 we have:

*   Early pilot implementations of core technology, with more work needed.
*   An experienced team working on multiple aspects of the project.

Team has decades of collective experience from:<br>
* Data modeling in ISO and Open<br>
Geospatial Standards organizations.<br>

* Google tech writers.<br>
* Glossary and open source software projects.<br>
* Requirements management community.</td>

Target pilot by 1st half 2022.</td>

<td>Piloted using <a href="https://www.iso.org/sites/directives/current/part2/index.xhtml#_idTextAnchor206">ISO's definition conventions</a>. Expect we will need to extend this guidance to address conventions used in other glossaries.<br>
Target 2022.</td>
