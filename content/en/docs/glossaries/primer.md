## Vocabulary formats

Glossaries are a specific instance of Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS). These vocabulary formats provide models for:

* Thesauri
* Classification schemes
* Taxonomies
* Folksonomies, and
* Other controlled vocabularies.

There are mature standards and supporting tools for publishing and maintaining controlled vocabularies.

* [Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/)
* [Resource Description Framework (RDF)](https://www.w3.org/RDF/)
* [Dublin Core Terms](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/)
* [Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/)
* [JSON for Linking Data (JSON-LD)](https://json-ld.org/)
* [Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/)
* [Web Ontology Language (OWL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/#OWL-REFERENCE)
* [schema.org](https://schema.org/)

Our _sharable glossary_ schema aggregates fields from these standards.
