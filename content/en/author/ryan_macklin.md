Ryan Macklin (he/they) is one of the founders of Empathy Advocacy, a branch of UX focused on how psychology and neurobiology are linked, with heavy respect for neurodiversity and trauma experiences.
{class="lead"}

Ryan joined The Good Docs Project in late 2020, and currently serves as one of the project's co-chairs.
He can technically be found on [Twitter as @adocgeek](https://twitter.com/adocgeek) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanmacklin/), but he's as likely to be working on some new accessibility tech for his home or doing some woodworking or gardening.
He'll also talk your ear off about game design and print publishing, as old loves of his.
