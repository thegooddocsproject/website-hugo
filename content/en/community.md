# The Good Docs Project Community

We are a community of technical writers, developers, UX designers, and more who work together to make software documentation better.
Whether you are new to documentation or a seasoned technical writer, joining our community will give you opportunities to mentor and be mentored by others, improve your documentation skills, and help make software documentation better.

Our [who are we](/who-we-are) page lists our active members who have taken up official roles.

## How to join us and start contributing

Our project is organized into small working groups of about 2-10 people who collaborate together to work on key project initiatives and tasks.
For that reason, one of the best ways you can get started is to look at our [list of working groups](/working-group/) and decide which group(s) you might want to join and contribute to.

Once you find a group that is working on a project that interests you:

* Join our [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/thegooddocs/shared_invite/enQtODkyNjI5MDc0NjE0LTUyNGFiZmU1MjIzNDMwN2E3NmQwODQwZmRkYWI5MDhlMzdjYzg4Nzg4YjM3ODA0NGE4MTgyYzdkMGViMTI2MDM) and add yourself to the channel for the working group you want to join.
* Most working groups meet on a regular basis (either weekly, every other week, or monthly). Check the meeting times for that group and our Google calendar for meeting details.

We also have general meetings where you can come and meet the project leaders and learn more about the project.

## Communicating with other members of the project

When engaging with members of our project, we ask that you follow our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/).

### Slack

We often chat in slack, you can join [here](https://join.slack.com/t/thegooddocs/shared_invite/enQtODkyNjI5MDc0NjE0LTUyNGFiZmU1MjIzNDMwN2E3NmQwODQwZmRkYWI5MDhlMzdjYzg4Nzg4YjM3ODA0NGE4MTgyYzdkMGViMTI2MDM).

The main channels are:

* #general: General discussions for everyone in the group
* #welcome: Join this channel and introduce yourself!

### Email lists

We use email lists, although sometimes the lists can be a little quiet.
Join our [groups.io](https://thegooddocsproject.groups.io/g/main) mailing list.

Why do we use email lists?

* They are archived.
* They work well for people working across multiple time zones and work patterns.
