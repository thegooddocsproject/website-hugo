# The Good Docs Project Community

We are a community of technical writers, developers, UX designers, and more who work together to make software documentation better.
Whether you are new to documentation or a seasoned technical writer, joining our community will give you opportunities to mentor and be mentored by others, build your professional network, improve your documentation skills, and help make software documentation better.

## How to join and contribute

Our project is organized into small working groups of about 2-10 people who collaborate together to work on key project initiatives and tasks.
For that reason, one of the best ways you can get started is to look at our [list of working groups](/working-group/) and decide which group(s) you might want to join and contribute to.

Once you find a group that is working on a project that interests you:

* Join our [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/thegooddocs/shared_invite/zt-be2gay0m-Ukq_5SI0MHp20IQP3auQjg) and add yourself to the channel for the working group you want to join.
* Most working groups meet on a regular basis (either weekly, every other week, or monthly). Check the meeting times for that group and our [calendar](#calendar) for meeting details.

We also have general meetings where you can come and meet the project leaders and learn more about the project.

## Communication forums

Everyone is welcome to join our forums. When engaging with members of our project, we ask that you follow our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/).

### Calendar

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jstimezonedetect/1.0.7/jstz.js"></script>

<iframe id="calendar_container" src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gooddocsproject%40gmail.com&ctz=Australia%2FSydney" style="border: 0" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<script type="text/javascript">
  var timezone = jstz.determine();
  var pref = 'https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gooddocsproject%40gmail.com&ctz=';
  var iframe_src = pref + encodeURIComponent(timezone.name().replace(' ' ,''));
  document.getElementById('calendar_container').src = iframe_src;
</script>

Our calendar lists our video meetings. Connection details are in the meeting details.

If you'd like to contribute regularly, you should ask the meeting lead to add you to the meeting invite. This means you can:
* Log in without approval from the meeting lead.
* Have the invite added to your personal calendar.

### Slack
