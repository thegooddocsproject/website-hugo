# The Good Docs Project Community

We are a bunch of technical writers, educators, product developers and power users who also write.
Some of us have big titles in large organisations; others donâ€™t.
We are committed to helping others write great documentation through this project.

Our [who are we](/who-we-are) page lists our active members who have taken up official roles.

## Communication

Email lists are our primary form of communication.
See the links above to the various resources available.

Why do we use Email lists? 

* They are archived. 
* They work well for people working across multiple timezones and work patterns.

### Slack

We often chat in slack, you can join [here](https://join.slack.com/t/thegooddocs/shared_invite/enQtODkyNjI5MDc0NjE0LTUyNGFiZmU1MjIzNDMwN2E3NmQwODQwZmRkYWI5MDhlMzdjYzg4Nzg4YjM3ODA0NGE4MTgyYzdkMGViMTI2MDM).

The main channels are:

* #announcements: Notifications of upcoming initiatives / releases / etc.
* #general: General development discussion
* #random: Non-work-related stuff

### Group virtual meetings

Everyone is welcome to join our working group video conference calls. Details for joining are in the calendar above.

Reach out in our #welcome slack channel to get a personal calendar invitation which means you can:
* Log in without approval from the meeting lead.
* Have the invite added to your personal calendar.
