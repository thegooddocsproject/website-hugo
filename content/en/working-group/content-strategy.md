The Content Strategy working group ensures that the content on our various communication channels supports our project's objectives and meets the needs of our contributors, users, and followers.

This group's will work on defining users by monitoring site analytics or conducting user research, defining who will help create content and how, and develop our content lifecycle.

Join this group if you are interested in user research, social media, and high-level discussions about content strategy!
